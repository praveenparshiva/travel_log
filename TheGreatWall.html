            <p>
                The <strong>Great Wall of China</strong> is one of the <strong>Seven Wonders of the World</strong>, the most iconic attraction in China, and the leading wonder among the <strong>Seven Wonders of China</strong>. Stretching an astonishing <strong>5,500 miles (8,850 km)</strong> across the country, it stands as one of the most remarkable feats of engineering in human history.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wall itself is comprised of <strong>3,889 miles (6,259 km)</strong> of man-made fortifications. The remaining distance is accounted for by <strong>223 miles (359 km)</strong> of trenches and <strong>1,387 miles (2,232 km)</strong> of natural barriers, including mountains and rivers that were incorporated into the defense system.
            </p>
            <p>
                When considering all branches of the wall, its total length extends to an astonishing <strong>13,171 miles (21,196 km)</strong>, making it one of the greatest architectural achievements in history.

                The <strong>Terracotta Army</strong> stands alongside the <strong>Great Wall of China</strong> as one of the <strong>Seven Wonders of Asia</strong> and remains one of the most celebrated historical and cultural attractions in China and all of Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
                This vast collection of life-sized terracotta sculptures represents the armies of <strong>Qin Shi Huang</strong>, the first emperor of China, and was created as funerary art to accompany him in the afterlife.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Terracotta Army consists of over <strong>8,000 soldiers</strong>, <strong>130 chariots</strong> pulled by <strong>520 horses</strong>, and an additional <strong>150 cavalry horses</strong>. These figures were buried with the emperor between <strong>210–209 BCE</strong> as part of a vast necropolis that spans <strong>38 square miles (98 sq. km)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each terracotta figure is life-sized and uniquely detailed, varying in uniform, height, hairstyle, and facial features—of which at least <strong>10 distinct face shapes</strong> have been identified.
