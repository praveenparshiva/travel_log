            <p>
                About 20,000 workers, including architects, masons, horticulture planners, artists, and carvers, each excelling in their respective fields of work, were employed by the Emperor Shah Jahan in building the Taj Mahal. The cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, lie side by side. The cenotaphs are richly decorated with inlay work and a marble lattice framework, which exhibit the expert workmanship and skill of the craftsmen who put their best into this historical monument.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cenotaphs are primarily for ornamental purposes, as the real graves lie in the crypt at a level lower than them. Decorations with inlaid semiprecious stones, the life-like bas reliefs, calligraphical representations of Koranic verses on the walls, the arch and dome profile of the marble building, and the perfect architectural symmetry of the entire monument are all listed among the features that make the Taj Mahal one of the most unique examples of architectural genius in the history of mankind.

                The best time to visit the Taj Mahal is during the months stretching from October through March. Access to the site remains partially restricted on Fridays, when only Muslims are allowed to enter for attending prayer ceremonies.
