    <h3>History of Chichén Itzá : </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Founded around the 6th century CE, Chichén Itzá was established by the Maya peoples, who had occupied the Yucatán Peninsula since the Pre-Classic or Formative Period (1500 BCE – 300 CE). The city's earliest structures were built in the <strong>Puuc architectural style</strong>, which differed from the designs found in the southern lowlands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the collapse of Maya cities in the 10th century, Chichén Itzá was invaded by Maya-speaking foreigners influenced by the <strong>Toltec civilization</strong> of central Mexico. Some evidence suggests that these invaders were the Itzá, while other theories propose that the Itzá arrived 200 to 300 years later.

    <h3>Weakening Of The Maya Influence :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Towards the end of the Classic Period (800–925 AD), the foundations of the magnificent Maya civilization weakened, leading to the abandonment of many major religious centers and surrounding rural lands.
            </p>
            <p>
                New, smaller cities were built, while great cities like Chichén Itzá were primarily visited for religious ceremonies and burials. The Itzá people left their city by the late 8th century AD, relocating to the west coast of the Yucatán Peninsula for approximately 250 years before returning to Chichén Itzá in the 10th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although some debate the specifics of this event, Toltec influence is evident in the city's art and architecture, suggesting active trade between the Toltecs and other Mesoamerican civilizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1000 AD, after forming alliances with other powerful regional tribes, the Itzá constructed significant new buildings featuring Toltec design elements, such as porches, galleries, colonnades, and carvings of serpents, birds, and Mexican deities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1194, the city of Mayapan broke its alliance with Chichén Itzá, leading to a gradual decline. A revolt erupted in 1221, escalating into civil war. During this period, the city's great marketplace and the <strong>Temple of the Warriors</strong> were burned, marking the beginning of Chichén Itzá’s final decline as Mayapan took control of the Yucatán.

    <h3>Significance Of Chichen Itza :</h3>

        <li>
            <p>
                Internationally recognized as one of the <strong>New Seven Wonders of the World</strong>, Chichén Itzá attracts tourists and religious pilgrims alike. One of its most iconic landmarks is the <strong>Pyramid of Kukulkán</strong>, which many do not realize was the heart of ancient Chichén Itzá.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pyramid’s design reflects Maya cosmology, depicting a serpent descending from the heavens to the Earth during the equinox. This phenomenon symbolizes the divine connection between humans and the gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chichén Itzá is among the best-preserved archaeological sites in the world and holds immense cultural significance. It is home to numerous architectural and natural wonders, including <strong>El Castillo, the Great Ball Court, the Temple of the Warriors,</strong> and the <strong>Sacred Cenote</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name <strong>Chichén Itzá</strong> has deep linguistic roots in the Maya language. <strong>"Chi"</strong> means "mouth," <strong>"Che’en"</strong> means "well," <strong>"Itz"</strong> translates to "magician" or "sorcerer," and <strong>"Há"</strong> means "water." Combined, the name is interpreted as <em>"The Mouth of the Well of the Water Sorcerers."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                More than just a historical marvel, Chichén Itzá embodies ancient humanity’s cultural, spiritual, and architectural achievements. Witnessing <strong>Chichén Itzá at sunrise</strong> is an unforgettable experience that captures the majesty of this sacred site.
