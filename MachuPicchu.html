    <h3>Where Is Machu Picchu? </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Located in the Cusco department of Peru, within the province of Urubamba, Machu Picchu is set in the namesake district and rises 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above sea level. Contrary to popular belief, it is actually lower in elevation than the city of Cusco, which lies about 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983, the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu Historic Sanctuary stretch across the basin of the Vilcanota-Urubamba River.

    <h3>History :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Long before the Cusco Kingdom developed as a city-state from 1300 to 1500 AD, the people of the Urubamba region had been practicing agriculture since 760 BC. First ruled by Manco Capac, the Vilcabamba region came under Inca control by 1440.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many believe that the royal estate of Machu Picchu was established around 1450 to honor the 9th Inca king, Pachacuti, who initiated the empire's territorial expansion into the Tahuantinsuyo Empire. Others suggest it was primarily a cultural and intellectual hub where the great minds of the empire gathered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city's population ranged from 300 to 1,000 people, consisting of the king's lineage, religious elite, and highly specialized artisans known as yanaconas. Agriculture remained the main economic driver until the king's passing, after which new constructions were built on the fertile valleys of the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the civil war, rural populations were annexed into the empire's labor force, only to return home after the conflict. However, following the exile of Manco Inca in Vilcabamba during the Spanish Conquest of 1532, the empire lost its significance, and Machu Picchu was abandoned—later becoming known as the legendary "Lost City of the Inca."

    <h3>What To Do In Machu Picchu  :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                While there is no shortage of artifacts to admire, those seeking adventure can take their experience to new heights by hiking to the top of Huayna Picchu—the iconic backdrop of a classic Machu Picchu postcard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hike includes navigating the infamous “Death Stairs,” a steep and seemingly perilous set of stone steps. However, those who conquer them are rewarded with a breathtaking, first-class view from the summit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another spectacular aerial view can be obtained from Machu Picchu Mountain, located on the opposite side of the ruins. Like Huayna Picchu, this climb also requires a permit but offers an equally stunning panoramic perspective.
