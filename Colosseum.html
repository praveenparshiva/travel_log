<h3>History :</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The struggles of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the growing public disinterest in the gladiator spectacles, put an end to the Colosseum's period of fame, for the meantime. The last gladiator battle was recorded in 435, while the human-versus-animal hunts continued for another century.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mistakenly, some believe that the battles at the Colosseum ended due to the emperors' growing passion for Christianity when, in reality, it was the cost of upkeeping the amphitheater and gathering the materials and participants for the spectacles that the already struggling Roman Empire could not handle.
        </p>
        <p>
            At one point or another since ceasing to be an entertainment venue for the ancient Romans, the Colosseum has functioned as a cemetery, a place for worship, living quarters, an artisans’ and merchants’ workshop, the home of a religious order, and a defense castle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neglected after that, with two-thirds becoming destroyed by lightning, earthquakes, and even vandalism—including the marble seats and decorative elements—the Colosseum, dismally, began to function as a source of building materials in the 18th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the projects that were built using its materials include St. Peter’s Basilica, St. John Lateran, the Palazzo Venezia, as well as the defense forts on the Tiber River.
        </p>

<h3>Gladiators  :</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The gladiators who fought against each other, animals, and in mock naval engagements were generally condemned criminals or prisoners of war, working as slaves. These were highly organized spectacles, with the fighters categorized by size and fighting styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experience, past record, and various fighting styles also determined the match's contenders, while the most successful gladiators had a chance of being recognized as celebrities in ancient Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making sure that the rules were followed, the referees also kept score, while the doctors at the scene ensured that not all battles had a fatal outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to these regulations, some gladiators had long careers without dying, making the battles less chaotic or bloody than often imagined. Still, it is believed that around 400,000 people died during these shows over 350 years.
        </p>

<h3>Construction  :</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Since Vespasian died before its completion, the construction—taking only eight years for such a grand project—was overseen by Roman engineers and craftsmen but done largely by Jewish slaves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The final stages of construction were completed under Titus and his brother and successor, Domitian.
        </p>
        <p>
            With an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 people employed in the construction of the Colosseum, the use of slave labor was a direct result of the aftermath of the First Jewish-Roman War.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the abolishment of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, many of the provincial inhabitants were enslaved and brought to Rome solely for this purpose.
