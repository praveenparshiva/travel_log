                Back in 1850, Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested erecting a Christian symbol for the city, but his idea was initially rejected. However, this proposal planted a seed in the minds of Brazil’s Catholics that would eventually grow into a world-renowned monument in the following century.

            <p>
                After Brazil established a republic in 1889—separating church from state—Catholics voiced their concerns that the world was heading toward doom due to increasing "godlessness." The push for a religious monument began in earnest after World War I when the Roman Catholic Archdiocese called for a symbol of faith to be installed in Rio de Janeiro.

                Permission was granted, and the stone base was laid on April 4, 1922, in a ceremony that also commemorated the 100th anniversary of Brazil’s independence from Portugal.

                Since the statue’s final design had yet to be decided, a competition was held the same year to determine its appearance. Among the contributors were French engineer Albert Caquot and Romanian artist Gheorghe Leonida. Ultimately, Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa was chosen for his sketches, although his original concept depicted Christ holding a cross and a miniature globe.

                Taking almost a decade to complete due to the dense vegetation covering the mountain and the statue’s massive scale, the entire project cost $250,000 USD. The statue was finally inaugurated in October 1931.

                Sculptor Paul Landowski fashioned the statue out of clay pieces, which were then shipped to Brazil. Once there, the structure was reassembled using reinforced concrete—a decision made to support the grand and wide-open arms stance, symbolizing Christ’s loving embrace of the world.

                However, Costa was not fully satisfied, believing that concrete was too rough for the representation of Christ. Inspired by a Parisian fountain near the Champs-Élysées, Da Silva Costa updated his design to incorporate soapstone tiles, which he felt would better reflect sunlight and create a divine glow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The soapstone was sourced from quarries in Ouro Preto, eastern Brazil, and the final sculpture was meticulously covered with 6 million soapstone tiles, giving Christ the Redeemer its distinctive, luminous appearance.

                While the first tourists visited the statue during its unveiling in 1931, today, over 15,000 visitors hike up or take the train daily to witness this famous landmark.

                Many choose the centenarian, eco-friendly Corcovado electric train, which winds through the lush Tijuca Forest before reaching the base of the statue. From there, visitors can access Christ the Redeemer via an elevator or escalator—where previously, they had to climb 200 steps to reach the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Couples can even wed under Christ the Redeemer at the Chapel of Nossa Senhora Aparecida, an extraordinary yet intimate location for marriage. However, space is limited, and the ascent to reach the chapel remains a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Christ the Redeemer is known by all, the history behind its origin and the fact that Brazilian Christianity is just one of the things the statue symbolizes, are often overshadowed by the grand stature.
