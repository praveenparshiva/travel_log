    <h3>Threats to Petra :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                While Petra is considered a safe destination compared to other cities in the region, tourists should be aware of occasional flash floods, particularly in the canyons after heavy rainfall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some local tribal groups may also attempt to scam tourists for money, making awareness an essential tool for staying safe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond these concerns, Petra faces threats from modern conveniences, such as the influx of cars and pollution, which can rapidly degrade its ancient structures. Vandalism, looting, and defacing of historic sites remain an issue, though less so than in the 1990s. Efforts by the <strong>Petra National Trust</strong> have significantly reduced such threats by implementing a risk management team dedicated to preserving the city's heritage.

    <h3>Petra's Habitat :</h3>

        <li>
            <p>
                The ancient Nabataeans accumulated immense wealth through their caravan-based trade, necessitating a fortified city hidden within the desert for protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The landscape of Petra features sand dunes, canyons, and water canals, making it an ideal crossroads for merchants. Today, the region is home to various species of birds and indigenous desert plants. While the Nabataean traders are long gone, their legacy continues, with Bedouin tribes now inhabiting the area.
